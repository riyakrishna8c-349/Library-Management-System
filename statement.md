Problem statement:
Managing library resources manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
Typical problems include:
* Difficulty in tracking issued books
* No proper record of students using the library
* Duplicate or missing entries
* Hard to check the availability of books
* Manual updates leading to mistakes
* No quick way to view issued/returned history
To solve this, a Library Management System is needed that can automate the process of managing books, students, and book-issuing transactions.
